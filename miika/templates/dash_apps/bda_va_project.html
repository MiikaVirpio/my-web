                I have always been facinated about looking aggregated data through an abstraction layer and especially in stock screening I have always tried so see that something that hides in plain sight. 
                While column calculations in a table and then ordering rows by the column indicator is powerful, I have never quite found Excel, or even PowerBI by extent, intuitive enough. 
                With newfound love for DataFrames, due all the studies in machine learning and data science, meeting visualization assignment to create a dashboard, the result of the confluence of interests is visible above!

                It might be easy to publish your data fiddling ideas as a Google Colab Jupyter Notebook, but its only selected audience who benefit from that ultimate interactivity of being able to copy and change code. 
                With enough Excel-fu, one might be able to share a sheet with few graphs and some interactivity, but there is that limit where you can go with that. 
                It is certainly not the easiest way to share a dashboard essentially developing a standalone app for it. 
                I am however, constantly surprised how fast the Dash javascript engine updates the visuals on screen and the underlying Plotly Python is speaking fluently the same language as my creativity.

                I designed the page not only to satisfy my Visual Analytics teacher for assignment, but to be of real value in my own stock screening and invesing. 
                Moreover, if I can, by sharing it publicly, spark even one idea in someone else that proves financially valuable to them eventually, my job is done. 
                Hopefully it works as it does now atleast until something changes at Inderes or yfinance. 
                Being an uncurable generalist/multipotentialite I will most propably be interested about learning something new already tomorrow.

                The page should be quite unbreakable, use it liberally, theres no trackers or ads or anything. 
                The code is open, free and publicly available in GitHub (button below). 
                Use it, steal it, host it, enhance it - and throw a shoutout at GitHub or LinkedIn if you feel like it!

                    This time the mind blowing magic was using same input field, the main company dropdown selection, as input to multiple plots and then having that field as OUTPUT for the market cap buttons! 
                    This way, when you click the button, the input selection for the dropdown is changed and all the plots are updated accordingly.

                    It is funny, how simple it is to scatter plot with <em class="text-warning">plotly.express</em> 
                    compared to the interactivity and value the <em class="text-warning">4DISS</em> graph brings! 
                    I did use quite a lot of time to try to affect the sizes, opacities and colours of the bubbles in the graph. 
                    While it would be possible with <em class="text-warning">graph_objects</em> the plotting code would be considerably more complicated. 
                    I would know because thats what I did first!

                    The oneliner timeseries query from <em class="text-warning">DataFrame</em> beats many other ways to get data but I cannot stop thinking, 
                    how production scale implementation of this would be better with well structured databases updating themselves from market APIs in the bacground 
                    and I would just have tiny api call to my my own DB to get what I want.

                      While the first plots were simple to craft, this does not atleast look like it. 
                      However, if you take a step back, there is not actually much other than subplot positioning happening. 
                      Only things a bit more complicated are the technical indicators I had in my backpocket created for another assignment previously.

                    For the main stuff we trust to the top dog Finnish analysts at Inderes! Luckily they provide a downloadable csv. 
                    It is not every company in the market and on top there is some companies trading in SEK followed as well so in truth our selection of companies is subset from Inderes's subset.
                    <br><br>
                    I do not know how often Inderes actually updates the csv. 
                    Filename downloaded from their website has date in it. 
                    Maybe file metadata would reveal it. On their site you can see when the recommendation was updated, 
                    I highly recommend their site.

                    it is a breeze to merge columns in using a foreign key-ish trick. 
                    Downloading prices is amazingly fast having 250 days x 150 companies x OHLC+V. 
                    I would still be conservative and that's why I store both the companies dataframe and the prices dataframe to a pickle so that data is fetched only once a day.
                    <br><br>
                    Thinking about this now during report writing, I could actually grab values from previous pickle and just fetch past few days combining the stuff, instead of getting YTD from scratch everyday. 
                    Then again, even better would be to update a real DB instead of a pickle or csv file.
